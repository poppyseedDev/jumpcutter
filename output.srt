00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 Okay, let's get...

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,960
 Okay, let's get started.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,680
 So the first website I want to show you is Exorcism.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,040
 My personal opinion is that this website is structured in a beginner friendly way.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,760
 So if you want to deep your toes into the rust programming language, but you don't want

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,440
 to go too deep too fast, I would strongly recommend it.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,320
 This website features a variety of different programming languages with which you can get

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,720
 started with.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,880
 And personally I would say it has a really nice, clean UI.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,600
 Maybe one of the issues that I found is that there aren't enough exercises for the rust

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,360
 programming language.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
 But maybe that will be added and changed in the future.
