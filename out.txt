{"text":" Okay, let's get... Okay, let's get started. So the first website I want to show you is exorcism. My personal opinion is that this website is structured in a brick-inner friendly way. So if you want to deep your toes into the Rasp programming language, but you don't want to like go too deep, too fast, I would strongly recommend it. This website features a variety of different programming languages with which you can get started with. And personally, I would say it has a really nice, clean UI. Maybe one of the issues that I found is that there aren't enough exercises for the Rasp programming language, but maybe that will be added and changed in the future. What maybe that will be added and changed in the future?","language":"en",
